Memory leak
- when 

Heap Dump
- can be used to find the memory leak
- use memory analyzer tool and find the object that has the biggest size
- read from bottom to top
- {OBJECT_NAME} {PACKAGE_NAME}.{CLASS_NAME}
- as long as the used memory in old generation does not grow in bounded look, there's no leak
